This is a tool-box for our experiments/stimulations on Mininet.

topo.py is a topo-gen tool. You can use 
  'python topo.py'

to generate a new topology. There is no restrict on the order of
'-h' and '-s'. The xx after '-h' is the number of hosts in that
topo, and yy after '-s' the number of switches. The new topo is 
linear topology, and each host is connect with a switch which have
the same number. If there are more hosts than switches, then the
(n+1)th host will connect to 1st switch.

scp_dhcp is a piece of DHCPDISCOVER packet generating code. You
can adjust in

	'sendp(dhcp_disc, loop=1, inter=0.2)'

where loop=1; loop=0 are enable and disable looping. And inter
controls the interval time between packets.
